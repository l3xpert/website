### The aim of Microservices Community is to ... around all aspects of designing and programming microservice architectures.

Activities of Microservices Community comprise:

- Organise the Microservices conference (http://conf-micro.services) once a year. If possible, have a fund to sponsor the travelling of participants.

- Help in the organisation of more focused workshops and other events. These may range from broad meetups between companies and/or researchers (like the Italian Meeting on Microservices, which was a huge success) to more local and technical workshops (e.g., like the Jolie international meetup, or specific workshops on other technologies like node.js, Erlang, Lambda, ...).

- Publish open access material on microservices, either through the website as informal publications (white papers), or through more formal channels.

- Provide hardware resources for the community website.
