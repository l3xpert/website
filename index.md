### The aim of Microservices Community is to ... around all aspects of designing and programming microservice architectures.

The main activities of the Microservices Community currently include, but are not limited to, the following.

- Organise the International Conference on Microservices once a year ([http://conf-micro.services](http://conf-micro.services)), which acts also as a recurring opportunity for the physical gathering of the community.

- Support the organisation of focused events on microservices. Examples include: technical workshops on industrial technologies, national meetings (like the [Italian Meeting on Microservices](http://www.italianasoftware.com/mom2016_eng.html)), and academic forums.

- Provide funding opportunities for travelling and the organisation of events in general.

- Publish open access material on microservices, either through the website as informal publications (white papers), or through more formal channels (like edited books with chapters from multiple authors, or journals).

- Provide resources for the digital platform of the community, including this website.
